Finite Automaton (FA) Project Documentation
Overview
This project implements a Finite Automaton (FA) in Java, allowing users to define, manipulate, and analyze finite automata. The FA is loaded from a file in a specific format, and various operations can be performed on it.


Project Components
1. FiniteAutomaton Class
The FiniteAutomaton class represents the FA and has the following attributes:

setOfStates: List of states in the FA.
alphabet: List of symbols in the alphabet.
transitionsList: List of transitions between states.
finalStates: List of final states.
initialState: The initial state.
fileName: The path to the file containing FA details.
Methods:
readFromFile(): Reads FA details from the specified file.
getSetOfStates(): Returns the list of states.
getAlphabet(): Returns the list of symbols in the alphabet.
getTransitionsList(): Returns the list of transitions.
getFinalStates(): Returns the list of final states.
getInitialState(): Returns the initial state.
isDFA(): Checks if the FA is a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA).
isAccepted(String seq): Verifies if a sequence is accepted by the FA.
nextState(String startState, String value): Returns the next state given the current state and input symbol.

2. Transition Class
The Transition class represents a transition in the FA and has the following attributes:

startState: The starting state of the transition.
value: The input symbol triggering the transition.
endState: List of possible states after the transition.

Methods:
Getter and setter methods for each attribute.
toString(): Returns a string representation of the transition.

3. Main Class
The Main class contains the main method and serves as the entry point for the program.

Methods:
display_menu(): Displays the menu of operations that can be performed on the FA.
main(String[] args): Executes the program, allowing users to interact with the FA.


Usage
Set of States Section:

States are specified on the second line after the "SET OF STATES" header.
States are separated by commas.
Alphabet Section:

The alphabet is specified on the second line after the "ALPHABET" header.
Symbols in the alphabet are separated by commas.
Transitions Section:

Transitions are specified on the line after the "TRANSITIONS" header.
Each transition is specified on a separate line and follows the format: startState, value, endState1, endState2, ....
Transitions are read until the "FINAL STATES" header is encountered.
Final States Section:

Final states are specified on the line after the "FINAL STATES" header.
Final states are separated by commas.
Initial State Section:

The initial state is specified on the line after the "INITIAL STATE" header.
Menu Operations:

Users can choose operations by entering the corresponding option number.
Options include displaying states, alphabet, transitions, final states, checking if the FA is a DFA, and verifying if a sequence is accepted.
