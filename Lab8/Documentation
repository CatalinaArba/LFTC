1.	Overview
The myscanner.lxi file is a Lex (Flex) program designed to recognize and classify tokens in a simple programming language. It recognizes keywords, operators, separators, identifiers, integer constants, string constants, and character constants.
 
 
2.	Preparation
Before compiling and running the program, ensure that you have a command prompt opened at the location of the myscanner.lxi file. Navigate to the directory using the cd command:
 
$ cd path/to/directory
 
Replace path/to/directory with the actual path where your myscanner.lxi file is located.
Once you are in the correct directory, proceed with the compilation and execution steps as described in the next sections.
 
 
3.	Compilation
Compliation: 
To compile the Lex file, use the following command:

$ flex myscanner.lxi

 
 
Generate Executable:
After compiling, you will obtain the lex.yy.c file. Use the following command to generate the executable:

 gcc  lex.yy.c 

 
 
Running the Program:
Run the compiled program by providing an input file as an argument:

a.exe p1.txt
Or
a.exe p2.txt
Or
a.exe p3.txt



Replace p1.txt with the path to your desired input file.
 

4.	Token Recognition
Reserved Words
Recognizes reserved keywords such as read, write, if, else, whileLoop, forLoop, boolean, char, int, double, string.
Operators
Identifies arithmetic and relational operators: +, -, *, /, %, <, <=, ==, !=, >=, >.
Separators
Recognizes separators including {, }, [, ], (, ), ,.
Identifiers
Matches identifiers according to the regular expression [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*.
Integer Constants
Matches integer constants using the regular expression 0|[-]?[1-9][0-9]*([.][0-9]+)?|[-]?0[.][0-9]+.
String Constants
Recognizes string constants enclosed in double quotes, e.g., "Hello, World!".
Character Constants
Matches character constants enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'a'.
